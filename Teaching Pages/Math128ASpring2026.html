    <p> Office hours Wednesdays and Thursdays 10:15 - 11:45 in Evans 762. Note that my office is Evans 787, just down the hall.</p>


    <br> 

    <p> Important Reminders:  </p>

    <p> 
      <ul>
        <li> Important Dates: Midterm 1: March 6th; Midterm 2: April 10th;Final Exam: 5/13 7 PM</li>
        
        <li> We are using the text <a href="https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/lib/berkeley-ebooks/detail.action?docID=4717637"> <em> Numerical Analysis : Mathematics of Scientific Computing </em> </a>, Third Edition
David Kincaid and Ward Cheney (<a href = "https://web.ma.utexas.edu/CNA/NA3/errata.html"> errata </a>). It is available from the Student Stores, and also online for free through your student account. The helpful part of this text is that it will match our coverage with MatLab (see the preface to find the coded algorithms). Professor Hass also has his previous lecture notes available on his personal website.</li>
        <li> There are plenty of other resources for conceptual understanding and review. For example, there is a <a href = "https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-330-introduction-to-numerical-analysis-spring-2012/" >MIT Opencourseware</a> for a similar course.</li>
        <li> We will be using MatLab to code various solvers for the class. You can find some instructions on how to download it <a href="https://software.berkeley.edu/matlab%C2%AE"> here </a>. There are certainly other options— popular software includes Julia and Python— but MatLab has some nice solvers built in. For a quick example on using MatLab, check the MatLab tab of this page.</li>
        <li>Grading and HW (Right off the Syllabus): Your grade will be split across 6 categories. The first 3 are 10% toward discussion activities, 10% to MatLab projects, and 10% to homework. Homework is due on Gradescope on Thursday evenings at 11:59, with 2 drops. MatLab assignments and discussion activities will be assigned weekly during discussion, also with 2 drops (so attendance of discussion is important!). The reamining 70% of your grade is from the midterms: 15% for midterm 1 on Friday, March 6th, 15% for midterm 2 on Friday, April 10th, and 40% for the finl, on Wednesday May 16th, 7-9:30 PM.</li>
        <li> AI Usage: coding is hard. Math is hard. Our goal here is to teach you how to do the math and implement it in code. At times, it may be easy to pass a problem to an LLM and have it do it for you, especially with coding projects where these programs can be very accurate. However, then you aren't working with the skills you need to develop and which you are taking the class to learn. That almost always catches up with students on the exams (if it is not caught as cheating on other assignments already) and in applying the skills in your future beyond 128A. That being said, AI can be a useful tool outside of the classroom when used correctly. Please only hand in code and projects written by you without the assistance of any LLM such as Chat-GPT or Grok and please try to limit your AI usage to things like debugging and checking your work. </li>

    <h3>Some Resources for MatLab </h3>

    <p> Everyone is coming to the class with a different level of coding knowledge, so here are some extra links to help you get started with MatLab. You can set up your MatLab account and download software by following the information <a href="https://software.berkeley.edu/matlab%C2%AE"> here </a>, but you can also use MatLab online for coding if you don't want to download it. There are lots of tutorials out there (the official MatLab onramp can be found <a href="https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/details/matlab-onramp/gettingstarted"> here </a>). We will teach you what you need in time, and I will include files for or from discussion or office hours here. I also ahve a quick-start to make you a little more comfortable with using MatLab below. </p>

    <p> <ul> 
      <li> Disc 1/27:<a href = "Math128ASp26 Files/fdd.m"> Matlab Function Demo 1</a>, <a href = "Math128ASp26 Files/Plotting.m"> Plotting Demo 2</a></li>
      <li>Disc 2/4: <a href= "Math128ASp26 Files/whileloops.m">While Loops Demo</a>, <a href="Math128ASp26 Files/Week3ExtraDemo.m"> Talyor Series Extra Demo</a></li>
  </ul> </p>


<p> Quickstart: this is a imple coding example for how to take a derivative of a function and use some basic file formats in MatLab. First, open the MatLab program. If you're signed in, you should see a file directory, perhaps an open file, and the command window. On the file directory, right click and create a new function. Name the file "fdd.m". It will have some example text involved. The file name is important because it is the function name you will call when you want to use this function in other files or the command window. </p>

<p> Next, we will define the function. The top line should start with "function" regardless of what else you want. We then have the function call, something like "output = fdd(input)". We will have one output, and three inputs. You should name these in a useful way when you write functions. For us, the top line will read "function deriv = fdd(fun, x, step)". Next, you should include a description of what the function does and what the inputs are. To write these, we use a percent sign to denote comments. An example line could be "%fdd: a function which returns the finite difference derivative at a point". Next, the body of the function does whatever you want it to. This is the part which we will make very complicated later on. For now, input the definition of the derivative. The whole file should look like this:
</p>
 <p>
  <code> function deriv = fdd(fun, x, step) <br>
%Finite-Difference Derivative <br>
%fun: the function you want to differentiate <br>
%x: the value you wish to differentiate at <br>
%step: the step for the derivative <br> 


deriv = (fun(x+step) - fun(x))/h</code>
<br>
</p>
<p>

Save the file, and move to your command line. We want a function to differentiate, so we need to initialize one in the command line. Write "f = @(x) x^2". This gives the function the name "f", where the @(x) denotes the variable involved and the x^2 means we have x squared. Notice that here I mean a math function, and above I'm talking about a coding function. Hit enter. You can now call the derivative function. Write "fdd(f,2,0.05)" in the command line and hit enter. If everything is correct, you should recieve back the value 4.05. Play around with different functions and values. You can also try writing an integral (note, MatLab has built in functions for these operations!)
