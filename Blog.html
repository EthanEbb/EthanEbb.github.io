        <h3> Generalizations of Well-Distributed Sets </h3>
      <p>
        In 1983, Walter Rudin published an argument in the American Mathematical Monthly (Well-Distributed Measurable Sets https://doi.org/10.2307/2975692) showing the existence of a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ such that $ 0 < m(A \cap [a,b]) < m(A)$ for the Lebesgue measure $m$ and any interval $[a,b]$. The argument relies on using appropriate generalizations of Cantor Sets. 

        <br>

        Here, we seek to investigate generalizations of this notion. First, it is immediate to generalize to multi-dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. Indeed, one may construct a dyadic-cube Cantor dust in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ of positive, finite Lebesgue measure (See Mattila's Geometry of Sets and Measures in Euclidean Space, Ch. 4). By making this dyadic, it is simple to follow Rudin's Process on subes as opposed to intervals. The resulting set will have positive partial measure in in any ball. 
        
        <br> 

        The second generalization is to apply this to Hausdorff $s$-measure $H^{s}$. The same process above can generate a set of positive, finite $H^{s}$-measure that exists partially in space, but it is not immediately clear what object we use to measure the well-distributed property. One option would be to use balls intersected with $s$-dimenional objects.

      <h3> Lower Bounds of Hausdorff Density: July 16th, 2025</h3>
      <p> 
        It is known from an argument of Besicovitch that for a set $A \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ such that $0< H^{s}(A) < \infty$, $$ 2^{-s} \leq \Theta^{*s}(A,x) \leq 1$$ for almost every point in $A$. For example, see Mattila's Geometry of Sets and Measures in Euclidean Space, Chapter 6. 
        <br>
        What we seek to show here is an example that the lower bound cannot be increased beyond $2^{-s}$. 

        First, we note a simple fact: in $B(0,1) \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$, we can place $2n$ balls of radius $0 < \lambda < \frac{\sqrt{2}-1}{2+\sqrt{2}}$. Indeed, placing their centers on the points $\pm (1-\lambda)e_{i}$ keeps them within the circle, and this specific value of $r$ is chosen so that for any pair of these balls $B_1$ and $B_2$ have $d(B_1,B_2) > 1$.
        
        <br>

        Next, we notice that for this $\lambda$, we may generate a generalized Cantor set as follows. 
        
        <br>

        Fix $s$ and pick some $n$ such that $2n > m$ where $m$ is the constant picked so $m \lambda^{2s} = \lambda^{s}$. Then, set $E_1 = B(0,1)$. Set $E_{2}$ to be some choice of $m$ balls among the choices $\pm (1-\lambda)e_i$. To generate $E_{k}$, on each ball $B_j$ present in $E_{k}$, we pick a sclaed-down arrangement as in the case of the choice for $E_2$, so that the resulting $A_{\lambda} = \bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} E_{i}$ is self-similar. 

        <br>
        
        It is known that $A_{\lambda}$ has Hausdorff dimension $s$ (see Mattila's Geometry of Sets and Measures in Euclidean Space, Chapter 4) and that $0 < H^{s}(A_{\lambda}) < \infty$. Without loss of generality, we may assume by rescaling that $H^{s}(A_{\lambda}) = 1$. 

        <br>

        Furthermore, let us pick some small value $r$ and $x \in A_{\lambda}$. We may take $\lambda^{k+1} \leq r < \lambda^{k}$. Notice that the balls in $E_{k+1}$ have radii $\lambda^{k+1}$, and the distance between the balls is at least $\lambda^{k}$ by the choice of $\lambda$ and the location of the balls. Hence, $B(x,r)$ contains at-most $1$ ball of level $E_{k+1}$ and  

        <br>
        $ \frac{H^{s}(A_{\lambda} \cap B(x,r) ) }{(2r)^{s}} \leq \frac{\lambda^{(k+1)s}H^{s}(A)}{(2\lambda^{k+1})^{s}} \leq 2^{-s}$
        <br>
        Finally, $\theta^{*s}(A_{\lambda},x) \leq 2^{-s}$. By Besicovitch's theorem, we have that $\theta^{*s}(A_{\lambda},x) = 2^{-s}$ for almost every $x \in A_{\lambda}$.
